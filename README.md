# Traffic Sign Detection AI

## Overview
This repository hosts the code and resources for an advanced AI-driven system developed for the detection and recognition of traffic signs. Our model leverages the YOLOv8 neural network architecture and is trained on a robust dataset from Mapillary, supplemented with local Hong Kong traffic sign images.

## Objectives
- Enhance the accuracy of traffic sign detection and recognition, ensuring real-time operation.
- Equip the system to handle diverse environmental conditions, with a focus on Hong Kong's unique traffic regulations and infrastructure.

## Methodology
1. **YOLOv8 Model**: Employing the YOLOv8 model for efficient and accurate real-time object detection.
2. **Dataset**: Utilizing a comprehensive dataset from Mapillary, enriched with local Hong Kong traffic sign images. 
3. **Training**: Conducting intensive training using an NVIDIA Geforce RTX 4080 graphics card.
4. **Deployment**: Implementing the model in a user-friendly web interface for real-time traffic sign detection.

## Findings & Results
- The system showed a high success rate in detecting standard traffic signs under typical conditions.
- Specific challenges were identified in recognizing unique Hong Kong-specific traffic signs and electronic displays.
